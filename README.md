# Capstone-Project: osrs-virtual-economy

This project analyzes the virtual economy of Old School RuneScape (OSRS) using historical Grand Exchange market data collected between:

February 1, 2025 – August 30, 2025

**Objectives:**

The goal of the project was to model price dynamics, detect structural changes, and identify clustering behavior across high-value in-game assets using time-series and unsupervised learning methods. The project contains the following: 


-API-based data scraper (OSRS Grand Exchange)

-Processed datasets in Parquet format

-Time-series feature engineering pipeline

-PCA-based dimensionality reduction

-K-Means clustering analysis

-Change-point detection (ruptures)

-Final submitted capstone paper (PDF)

_*The included Parquet files reproduce the exact dataset used in the final paper to ensure methodological consistency._

**Methods:**

-Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

-K-Means Clustering

-Silhouette Score Evaluation

-Autocorrelation Function (ACF)

-Change-Point Detection (ruptures)

-Time-Series Visualization

-Volatility and Return Engineering
